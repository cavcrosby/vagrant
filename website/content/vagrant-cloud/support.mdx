# Contacting Support

~> **Note**: You will need a Hashicorp Zendesk account to submit a support ticket. You may create an account [here](https://hashicorp.zendesk.com/auth/v2/login/registration)
or when prompted by selecting the `New to Hashicorp? Sign up` link at the bottom of the sign in widget.

To submit a support ticket:
1. Go to our [Support Page](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us). You may find the answers you need by searching our support knowledge base, but if not select `Open a new ticket`.
2. To submit a new support request select `Other / No Contract` and after reading the SLA disclaimer click `I still want to submit a ticket`.
3. You will then be prompted to log in to a Hashicorp specific zendesk. If you do not have an account you can create one by clicking the `Sign up` link at the bottom of the sign in widget.

### Free Support

We do not currently publish support SLAs for free accounts, but endeavor to
respond as quickly as possible. We respond to most requests within less than 24
hours.

## HashiCorp Tools Support

It's often the case that Vagrant Cloud questions or feedback relates to
the HashiCorp tooling. We encourage all Vagrant Cloud users to search for
related issues and problems in the open source repositories and mailing lists
prior to contacting us to help make our support more efficient and to help
resolve problems faster.

Visit the updating tools section for a list of our tools and their project
websites.
